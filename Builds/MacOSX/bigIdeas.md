#  Big Ideas for Generating Shit


## Generalization

Define a CONSTRAINT
Be able to generate things that meet that CONSTRAINT
if we can generalize this we can code up new ideas really fast
if it is too slow for specific things, we can come up with specific ways to speed those things up
can have a few different kinds of constraints - constraint on an entire phrase, constraint between any two adjacent notes, rhythm/time constraints vs. harmonic constraints vs. melodic constraints, etc.


## Classes and functionalities:

### rhythmic:
    Core Rhythms / structures
    Connecting material between core rhythms
    Ornamentation
    Fills

### harmonic:

### melodic:



## From user perspective:
want to input:
form length
section lenghts inside form
vibes, per section, vibes should be continuous values and can be dynamic
